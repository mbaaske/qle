Simulation-Based Quasi-Likelihood Estimation

# Abstract
We provide a method for parameter estimation of parametric statistical models which can be at least
simulated and where standard methods, such as maximum likelihood, least squares or Bayesian
algorithms (including MCMC) are not applicable. We follow the \emph{quasi-likelihood} theory to estimate the unknown model parameter by finding a root of the so-called \dfn{quasi-score} estimating function. For an overview of our method and further in-depth examples please see the vignette.
